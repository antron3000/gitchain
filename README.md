# Gitchain

### A Decentralized Blockchain-based File Storage and Sharing System. 

Upload your Projects or important codes/files and store them permanently and free of cost on the Ethereum Blockchain. Your files will be completely secured and safe as the transactions on the Blockchain are immutable and practically unhackable. You can also follow other users just like Github and check out their projects...


## Getting started

These instructions will get you started with using **Gitchain** :

1. Open Google Chrome or Firefox browser.
2. Install Metamask. Refer [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) guide for Metamask installation. Congratulations! You are now connected to Ethereum Blockchain.
3. Select the Rinkeby Test Network instead of Main Ethereum Network.
4. Now, we need some Ether in order to perform any transaction on the Application. For this, click in this [link](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Use either of the two methods to request ether in your Ethereum Account. To copy your Ethereum address, click the Metamask extension and click on the Account name.
5. After pasting the required URL, select the last option i.e. 18.75 Ethers/3 days and your account will be funded!
6. Now, open the [Project Link](https://gitchain.now.sh).
7. In your Metamask extension, click on the top left account logo -> Settings -> Connections. Copy-paste the project link in the box provided and click on Connect.
8. Refresh the page and Voila! You are ready to use the Application. Signup into the application and Happy Coding and Sharing!!
